# Qualification_CodeJam2016
These are my solvings for the qualification round of the 2016 Google Code Jam.
You can find all the problems and their corresponding descriptions here: 
https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/6254486/dashboard
<ul>
<li>Sheeps is problem A</li>
<li>ROTP is problem B</li>
<li>Coins is problem C</li>
<li>(and I didn't even make an attempt to solve problem D)</li>
</ul>
All of the input files are the <b>Large Input</b> files that I got in the contest.
Within the ROTP folder there's the official solving, written and prepared by <b>Ian Tullis</b> 
and within the Coins folder there's a JS script written by <b>Albano Pe√±a (https://github.com/albanow)</b>.
